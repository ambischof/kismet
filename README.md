# Kismet Scorecard

Before you ask, Kismet is a dice game almost identical to Yatzee. You must roll and optionally reroll 5 dice, and try to achieve various combinations.

This project was inspired while playing Kismet and almost running out of the scorecard pads printed in the 70s. Fast forward a few years, and I came back to this idea when I needed to learn React.

## What this project is

This project was made to help me learn React. And in an app that you probably haven't seen before.

## What this project is not

I spent no time in making this look good. I also didn't try to add in other gameplay elements that a digital version could provide, at least not in this iteration.


## Demo
